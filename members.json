Fusing her art practice with her scientific work, Emma has been a recurring volunteer on the Marine Debris Grant Project and the Cloud Forest Restoration Project on Santa Rosa Island for the past eight years. Each trip to the island recharges her inspiration to communicate oceanic climate change through art as a catalyst for conversations that confront the way we think about sustainability. Emma is most excited about getting students engaged with the Marine Debris project and expanding a diverse network of ocean activists.",

Karen’s first island project was to grow native plants for seabird habitat on Scorpion Rock. Karen continued to work on the islands building a nursery on Santa Barbara Island, growing plants to support the nesting requirements of Cassin’s Aucklets and Scripp’s murrelets. On Santa Cruz Island, under the direction of USGS Kathryn McEachern, Karen worked towards the recovery of rare and endangered plant species, propagating Malacothamnus fasciculatus var. nesioticus, Island bush mallow and monitoring other endangered species. In 2016 Karen accompanied Kathryn to Santa Rosa Island to evaluate the nursery and develop a plan for its future use in propagating plants for the Cloud Forest Project. Over the next few years Karen brought SBCC students to the island to “learn by doing” on island projects.",

Another class caps their semester with a paper and poster on the sustainability-related topic of their choosing, whether food packaging or seasonal and local eating.\n\nNow, Giovanni is trying to spur similar awareness and enthusiasm among her fellow faculty, so they too make it part of their curriculum.",
