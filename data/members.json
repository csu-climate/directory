Karen continued to work on the islands building a nursery on Santa Barbara Island, growing plants to support the nesting requirements of Cassin’s Aucklets and Scripp’s murrelets. On Santa Cruz Island, under the direction of USGS Kathryn McEachern, Karen worked towards the recovery of rare and endangered plant species, propagating Malacothamnus fasciculatus var. nesioticus, Island bush mallow and monitoring other endangered species. In 2016 Karen accompanied Kathryn to Santa Rosa Island to evaluate the nursery and develop a plan for its future use in propagating plants for the Cloud Forest Project.

    "Sustainability Contributions": "Recent projects include Climate justice in nursing education. Updated her courses to encourage students to examine how nursing and climate change intersect and impact their lives, whether they’ve experienced a megafire or grew up amid the scorching temperatures of the Central Valley. Her classes emphasize community health, and she encourages students to think critically about vulnerable and marginalized populations and how they are disproportionately affected.\n\nAt the faculty level, Brown Blake has encouraged her colleagues to incorporate more solutions and case studies on climate change and less emphasis on problem-focused lectures. This change resulted in Chico State joining the national Nurses Climate Challenge, an initiative that challenges nursing programs to demonstrate their commitment to teaching innovative content that addresses climate change and its impact on health.",
