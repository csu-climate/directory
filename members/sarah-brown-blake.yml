Sustainability Contributions: 'Recent projects include Climate justice in nursing
  education. Updated her courses to encourage students to examine how nursing and
  climate change intersect and impact their lives, whether they’ve experienced a megafire
  or grew up amid the scorching temperatures of the Central Valley. Her classes emphasize
  community health, and she encourages students to think critically about vulnerable
  and marginalized populations and how they are disproportionately affected.


  At the faculty level, Brown Blake has encouraged her colleagues to incorporate more
  solutions and case studies on climate change and less emphasis on problem-focused
  lectures. This change resulted in Chico State joining the national Nurses Climate
  Challenge, an initiative that challenges nursing programs to demonstrate their commitment
  to teaching innovative content that addresses climate change and its impact on health.'
