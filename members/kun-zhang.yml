Sustainability Contributions: 'Real-world examples take center stage in his classroom,
  from heatwaves causing buckled pavement in the Pacific Northwest to extreme rainfall
  leading to flooding. By discussing news reports and state agency perspectives on
  climate change and resilient infrastructure design, he helps students realize the
  importance of their work.


  Students in his “Transportation Engineering Lab” study these issues in depth and
  develop strategies to mitigate their effects through resilient infrastructure.'
