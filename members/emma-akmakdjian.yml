Sustainability Contributions: A self-proclaimed ‘creative ecologist,’ Emma likes to
  challenge dichotomies of art and science in her practice as a mixed media artist
  by using scientific byproducts including climate data, marine debris, and storytelling
  to speculate origins of bio cultures and our interconnectedness with the ocean.
  Fusing her art practice with her scientific work, Emma has been a recurring volunteer
  on the Marine Debris Grant Project and the Cloud Forest Restoration Project on Santa
  Rosa Island for the past eight years. Each trip to the island recharges her inspiration
  to communicate oceanic climate change through art as a catalyst for conversations
  that confront the way we think about sustainability. Emma is most excited about
  getting students engaged with the Marine Debris project and expanding a diverse
  network of ocean activists.
