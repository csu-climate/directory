Sustainability Contributions: Research focuses on understanding how plants respond
  to changing environmental conditions. Rising global temperatures are exacerbating
  droughts and other extreme weather events. By experimentally manipulating climate
  in the field and/or greenhouse, we can test hypotheses about how climate change
  may alter plant physiology, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes.
