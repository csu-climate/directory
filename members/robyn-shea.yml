Sustainability Contributions: Robyn has been working on the Channel Islands since
  2006 and was integral early on in helping establish Biosecurity protocols for the
  islands. Robyn's work includes Island Fox monitoring and recovery, invasive plant
  control and eradication, invasive species management and surveys, rare plant surveys,
  long-term marine debris surveys and removal, long-term photo point monitoring, long-term
  sandy beach monitoring and other park and island partner initiatives. I look for
  opportunities to provide support to partners and researchers as well as finding
  ways for students and faculty to engage with experts, obtain skills and experience
  to support graduation and career development, and contribute to partner initiatives
  that also support undergraduate research and learning
