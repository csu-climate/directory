Notes: For the CMGT 385 Sustainable Construction class the students will research
  ways to improve sustainability in the built environment, specifically on Chico State’s
  campus to support our Strategic Priority of Resilient and Sustainable Systems and
  goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030. The office, now housed in Academic Affairs,
  is led by former Construction Management department chair Marie Patterson (Construction
  Management, ’00; MS Geography, ’13) and directly supports sustainability efforts
  across campus. The expanded program is responding in part to the Associated Students
  ballot initiative earlier this year calling for reinstatement of sustainability
  in the University’s five-year playbook that passed with more than 90% support. The
  sustainability program previously was under Facilities Management and Services.
