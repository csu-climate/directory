  This lesson can be used to guide reagent use by students when preparing a buffer solution in an analytical chemistry laboratory.
  The suggested context would be to walk through it together in the analytical laboratory before preparing the buffer solutions.
  Quantities may need to be revised and recalculated during the laboratory if a student's buffer solution does not meet specifications.
  About an hour during lab should be allocated to this module; students may also ask questions when recalculating.

  This module provides practice to reinforce programming concepts introduced in prior modules for students with no prior coding experience.
  
  Teaching tips:
  - This lesson reinforces the utility of variables and functions for quickly recalculating important quantities.
  - Students may safely use a scale factor larger than 25 to achieve sufficient buffer capacity; potentially up to 100.
    Of course the scale factor can be increased beyond 100, but needing to do so may be a sign of cross-contamination.
  - After changing the scale factor, students must re-run both Task 3 and Task 4 to recalculate reagent quantities.
  - For students with a liquid acid, this lesson illustrates the use of commented-out code for contingent use cases.
  - Students should be reminded to always add acid to water, never water to acid, and preferably to do so in the hood.
  - While this lesson is not as challenging as others, that can compensate for the technical challenge of buffer preparation.
    Its ease of use promotes good planning prior to preparation of buffers, which is an important analytical laboratory skill.
  - Students should be permitted to consult with others, to ensure they are accountable to understand each part.
  - Encourage students to share ideas but code/answer questions in their own copy of the notebook.
  - Remind students to save their own copy before they begin work.
  - Some students may have several Google accounts; remind them to be aware of which account is logged in when they save.
  
  Timing notes:
  - Task 1 typically takes students 5-10 minutes.
  - Task 2 typically takes students 5-10 minutes.
  - Task 3 typically takes students 10-15 minutes, as savvy students may debate increasing the scale factor right away.  
    If they do so, they are less likely to need to recalculate and re-make their solution with a higher buffer capacity.
  - Task 4 typically takes students 10-15 minutes, as students decide if their acid is a solid or a liquid, decide what
    to do with the commented-out code for liquid acids, and look up the needed molar masses and (if needed) density.
  - If necessary, recalculating with a higher scale factor (Tasks 3 and 4) should take students no more than 5 minutes.
  
  Common student questions:
  - Students may ask if they should just start with an increased scale factor.
  - Students may ask how to dispense liquid acids.  Micropipettes are the most accurate, but MUST be handled very carefully.
    Please supervise students if they have not yet been trained in safe handling of micropipettes.
  - Students may ask if the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is sufficiently accurate.  This does not account for small ionic
    strength effects on pH, but it greatly simplifies the code, and it should be sufficiently accurate for this purpose.
