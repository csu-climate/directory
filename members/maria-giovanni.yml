Sustainability Contributions: 'After Giovanni’s participation in the inaugural FLC,
  her students now study how Chico State’s Associated Students Dining has reduced
  food waste in its kitchen, and how Enloe Health uses a food rescue program at its
  hospital to find uses for surplus sandwiches and other prepared foods. They also
  discuss regenerative farming, ecolabeling, and the environmental consequences—positive
  and negative—of plant-based meat substitutes like Beyond Meat.


  One assignment has students conduct a personal food waste audit, to realize their
  contributions to the waste stream and related squandered resources that went into
  producing, transporting, and packaging the tossed product. Another class caps their
  semester with a paper and poster on the sustainability-related topic of their choosing,
  whether food packaging or seasonal and local eating.


  Now, Giovanni is trying to spur similar awareness and enthusiasm among her fellow
  faculty, so they too make it part of their curriculum.'
