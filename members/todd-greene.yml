Research Interests: Dr. Greene’s broad areas of research interests include tectonics
  and sedimentation, sequence stratigraphy and depositional systems. He focuses mainly
  on basin scale questions using a variety of technologies to address paleogeographic
  and tectonic histories of basins. I mainly work with core, outcrop, shallow 3-D
  seismic data, and modern analogs to piece together depositional facies models for
  volcanic-derived deposits (eg. the Tuscan Formation, the main aquifer for the town
  of Chico), shallow marine clastic sequences, as well as deep-water sediment gravity
  flows and related bioturbation (eg. Eel River basin and the Great Valley Group of
  northern California).
