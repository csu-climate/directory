Sustainability Contributions: Karen has been working on the Channel Islands for over
  twenty years collaborating and partnering with agencies, nonprofits and others who
  love the islands. Karen’s first island project was to grow native plants for seabird
  habitat on Scorpion Rock. Karen continued to work on the islands building a nursery
  on Santa Barbara Island, growing plants to support the nesting requirements of Cassin’s
  Aucklets and Scripp’s murrelets. On Santa Cruz Island, under the direction of USGS
  Kathryn McEachern, Karen worked towards the recovery of rare and endangered plant
  species, propagating Malacothamnus fasciculatus var. nesioticus, Island bush mallow
  and monitoring other endangered species. In 2016 Karen accompanied Kathryn to Santa
  Rosa Island to evaluate the nursery and develop a plan for its future use in propagating
  plants for the Cloud Forest Project. Over the next few years Karen brought SBCC
  students to the island to “learn by doing” on island projects.
