Research Interests: 'Dr. Geszvain’s research focuses on bacteria that oxidize manganese
  (Mn), converting the soluble reduced metal to insoluble Mn oxide minerals. These
  minerals are powerful oxidants that are capable of breaking down environmental contaminants.
  Therefore, her research hopes to employ Mn oxidizing bacteria in bioremediation.

  Bacterial physiology

  Metal transformations by environmental bacteria'
Teaching Interests: ''
Sustainability Contributions: The Geszvain Lab uses genetic approaches to understand
  the physiology and mechanism of manganese oxidation by environmental bacteria. The
  manganese minerals produced by these bacteria have been utilized in bioremediation
  of contaminated wastewater. Therefore, a long-term goal of the lab is the generation
  of strains optimized for remediation.
