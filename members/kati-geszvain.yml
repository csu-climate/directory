Research Interests: 'Bacterial physiology

  Metal transformations by environmental bacteria'
Teaching Interests: ''
Sustainability Contributions: The Geszvain Lab uses genetic approaches to understand
  the physiology and mechanism of manganese oxidation by environmental bacteria. The
  manganese minerals produced by these bacteria have been utilized in bioremediation
  of contaminated wastewater. Therefore, a long-term goal of the lab is the generation
  of strains optimized for remediation.
