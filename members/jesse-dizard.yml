Research Interests: 'Dr. Dizard (University of California at Berkeley, 2003) is a
  cultural anthropologist primarily interested in controlling processes. His research
  explores the existence and impacts of the pleasures of prejudice in a variety of
  contexts: the conceptualization and exploitation of ‘nature’; the social construction
  of categories of ‘enemy’ and ‘belonging’; the experience of violence, ‘identity
  formation’ and social inequality among ethnic minorities, particularly Native Americans,
  as well as children and women; and with regard to questions of authenticity, interpretation
  and narrative.'
